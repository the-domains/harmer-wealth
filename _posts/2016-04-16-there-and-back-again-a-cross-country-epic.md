**We protect capital.**

**We study political and global economic events, look for secular trends, track relevant supply and demand statistics, research and scrutinize individual securities, and employ innovative techniques such as portfolio insurance---all with the goal of protecting the capital that our clients have entrusted with us.**

### **We find opportunity.**

**Over time, investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate fluctuate in value. At Cumberland we invest in areas that are undervalued, and avoid those that are overvalued. This approach has helped our team outperform throughout significant market events and cycles from the 1970s to the present.**

### **We focus on you.**

**As a client, your portfolio will reflect your individual needs---whether that's the desire to grow your assets, preserve your wealth, generate a reliable stream of income, or some combination of these objectives. Your Client Portfolio Manager, together with our client service team, is dedicated to providing you with advice and truly personalized service.**
